    Abstract base class for attacks on sender-receiver datasets.

        Execute the attack on the provided dataset.

        Parameters
        ----------
        X : np.ndarray
            Count matrix of senders per round, shape [n_rounds x n_senders].
            Each row represents how many times each sender was active in that round.
        Y : np.ndarray
            Count matrix of receivers per round, shape [n_rounds x n_receivers].
            Each row represents how many times each receiver was addressed in that round.

        Returns
        -------
        np.ndarray
            Estimated senderâ€“receiver transition matrix of shape
            [n_senders x n_receivers].
